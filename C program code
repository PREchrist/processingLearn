Today we are Tuesday, January 21st 2020

  I have a quick warm up which get hot my braind, think i am adapting day in and day out. So, for today, in was question to write a program C which design 10 numbers vectors. To be done, it was not like usually we proceed or go ahead that's mean we haven't a user and think have to be designed otherwise. 
  Here down i have to post to codes for those programming.
 
 #program1

#include <stdio.h>

// int main(void) {
//   int myarray[10]={0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};

//   for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
//     printf("Element %d, %d\n", i, myarray[i]);

//   }
//   return 0;
// }

#program 2

int main(void){
  int myarray[10]={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
  
  for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
    printf("Element %i, %i\n",9-i, myarray[9-i]);
  }

  return 0;
}
